                    It focuses on the use case of <span className="boldtext">"semantic image search"</span>  which allows us search for images by content.
                    To implement this, a Convolutional Neural Network <span className="italics"> looks </span> at the content of an images
                    and can find all other images similar to that image.
                    It also provides an interface for viewing the features learned by layers in a pretrained CNN.

                    CNNs learn hierarchical representations which are useful for multiple tasks - early layers in a CNN learn low level features 
                    (e.g. colours, lines, edges, shapes) while later layers learn high level concepts (e.g eyes, legs, faces, doors, etc.)

                ConvNet playground focuses on  a simple example of 
                    semantic search using 
                        
                neural networks - <span className=" italics">
                   given a dataset of existing images, and a new arbitrary image (search query), find a subset of images from the 
                        dataset that are most similar to the new image.       
                </span>
                    
                &nbsp; In this implementation, we extract features (embeddings) for images in our dataset and compute similarity as the distance between these embeddings.
                    We perform this using multiple configurations (datasets, models, layers distance metrics) 
                    and allow the user to interactively ask questions of the results.

                        Note that the approach in this prototype (use of features from pretrained models) is relatively simple and 
                        hence has limitations (scale, matching multiple objects in search query, accuracy). 
                        In practice, we can extend this work by fine-tuning specialized models for given datasets, 
                        leveraging additional information (e.g text descriptions, interaction logs, purchase logs etc)
                        in constructing more meaningful embeddings or 
                        using a two stage approach for matching multiple objects in the search query (extract object crops and use as search queries).

                    No. We have precomputed all of the values beforehand. We have extracted features from all images in our dataset
                    using layers (intermediate models) from all supported models. We have also precomputed the similarity between each of these features
                    and show these results based on your selections.
